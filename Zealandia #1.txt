*Political issues are the total sum, but in chronological order. Despite only White Male landowners being the only ones to vote, provide stances to other groups for when they’re unlocked. Do not let players see reputation with a population that cannot vote. White Male Landowners = 7% of Male Europeans
*Political factions may evolve, decline, or new ones be made. Provide GMs tools to edit. Note: Will AI have to restructure.
*Create annual population growth: positive. Events will modify negative if needed
*Annual data on province & country updates every 12 turns, show metric for percent change (delete past data unused for metric)
*Reputation data by population demographics updates every 3 turns, show metric for percent change (delete past data unused for metric)


Political Scale Architecture 
* Based on *Political Scale and Issue Scale
* Political Cube
   * Policy Position: Every bill/event will have an associated position (Xp​,Yp​,Zp​) on this cube.
   * Initial NPC Positions: NPC positions are set based on their cultural group, class, and location (e.g., Dutch Settler Farmers in Cooksland will have a cluster of positions).
* Beyond the cube, the system uses the 34 specific policy issues listed in the source material.
   * Policy Position: Each specific issue (e.g., Women's Suffrage ) is a 1-dimensional scale, −10 (Traditional Roles) to +10 (Universal Suffrage). A proposed bill will have a score on relevant issues.
   * Issue Salience: Each demographic group (e.g., Upper Class Doctors ) has an Issue Salience score for each of the 34 issues (0 to 1.0, sum of all 34 ≤ 10.0). A higher score means a group cares more about that issue, and it will magnify their reputation change from a policy.


Reputation System Architecture 
* With help of *Political Scale Architecture
* Multi-Dimensional Demographic System
   * Layer 1: Economic  * Occupation * Gender
   * Layer 2: Culture * Religion
   * Layer 3: Special Interest
*Approval Calculation Formula
Reputation (Approval) for a Player (P) with a specific Group (G) is a score from 0% to 100%.
ΔApprovalP,G​=∑(Issue Match×Issue Salience×Issue Weight)+∑(Cube Match×Cube Weight)
*Issue Match: Measures how closely the Player/Policy stance aligns with the Group's preferred stance on specific issues (higher salience means greater impact).
*Cube Match: Measures the distance in the 3D cube between the Player/Policy position and the Group's default ideological position.
