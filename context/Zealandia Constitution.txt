THE CONSTITUTION ACT OF ZEALANDIA, 1852

An Act to Grant a Representative Constitution to Her Majesty's Colony of Zealandia



PREAMBLE
Whereas it is expedient to grant a Representative Constitution to the Colony of Zealandia, and to make provision for the establishment of a General Assembly and of Provincial Legislatures for the better governance thereof, recognizing the distinct geographical divisions of the territories of the Crown.



PART I - THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
Section 1. Composition
The Colony of Zealandia shall be governed by a General Assembly, consisting of:

* The Governor - Appointed by the Crown, holding the prerogative powers.
* The Legislative Council (Upper House) - Members appointed for life by the Governor, advising on legislation and representing the wisdom and stability of the colonial gentry.
* The House of Representatives (Lower House) - Members elected by the colonists, based on population, with representation distributed across the Provinces.

Section 2. Powers and Functions
The General Assembly shall have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Colony, including trade, customs, currency, and defense. Laws passed by the General Assembly shall supersede any laws passed by the Provincial Councils.



PART II - THE PROVINCES AND PROVINCIAL COUNCILS
Section 3. Division of Provinces
The Colony of Zealandia is hereby divided into Seven Provinces:

* New Zealand - Capital: Wellington
* Tasminata
* Vulteralia - Capital: Auckland
* Cooksland - Capital: Cook's Landing
* Southland
* New Caledonia
* Orketers

Section 4. Provincial Governance
Each Province shall have an elected Superintendent as its chief executive officer, and a Provincial Council elected by the colonists, with power to make ordinances regarding local works, roads, schools, police, and land sales within its boundaries.



PART III - LAND RIGHTS AND NATIVE AFFAIRS
Section 5. Land Sales
All lands of the Crown are vested in the General Assembly, which may delegate powers over land sales to the Provincial Councils, save and except lands held by the Maori in common or individually.

Section 6. Maori Lands
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the provisions regarding Maori title as secured under the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi). All purchases of Maori land must be made solely by the Crown or its authorized agents.

Section 7. Bi-Cultural Rights
Due to the unique history in Vulteralia, any colonist of partial Maori and partial French or Spanish descent shall be granted voting rights based on the same property qualifications as European colonists, provided they reside within a Provincial District.



PART IV - ELECTORAL QUALIFICATIONS
Section 8. Voters
The franchise shall be granted to adult male colonists who own freehold land of a certain value, or who occupy a tenement of a certain annual rental value.

Section 9. Exclusion
While all men of European descent meeting the property qualification may vote, the exclusion of men of color, or those who do not meet the specified property qualifications, severely limits the franchise, particularly among the Maori population and the lower classes in the rapidly growing ports of Southland.



PART V - ESTABLISHMENT OF RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT
Section 10. Responsible Government
This Act makes initial provision for representative government. The eventual shift to Responsible Government (where the Governor is bound to follow the advice of ministers chosen from the elected House of Representatives) is anticipated, providing the necessary constitutional framework for full colonial self-determination after 1854.
