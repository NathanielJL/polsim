Comprehensive Game Initialization Questions
1. POLITICAL SYSTEM FOUNDATION
Party System:
* How many political parties exist at game start (1853)?
* Party names, ideologies, and founding dates?
* Which parties have seats in which provincial legislatures?
* Are there national-level parties or only provincial parties?
* Party membership numbers and organizational strength per province?
* Key party platforms on major issues (land, Māori rights, immigration, tariffs)?
There would be 3 factions at the beginning of the game. (1854) This would be the Loyalty League, the Miscegenation Block, and the Broader Reform Faction (you can name). 
Loyalty League: Conservative/Reactionary, Strict Property Rights, Abolition of Bi-cultural rights. Issues (as per question 1.6): Non-expansionist, segregationist, tight-immigration, anti-tariff. Miscegenation Block: Progressive, Universal Male Suffrage, Reformists.!Issues (as per question 1.6): Expansionist, Maori-autonomy, free-immigration, anti-tariff Broader Reform Faction: Moderate, Reformist, Devolutionism.!Issues (as per question 1.6): Expansionist, segregationist, tight-immigration, pro-tariff. There are only provincial parties, but there can also be repeating parties or alliances if organized by players (players can do this through discord or other chats). Parties may also endorse politicians and campaign (action provided to party leader, if a group/counsel leadership for multiprovincial party, GMs can handle it) Parties will have two actions: Raise Funds and Campaign (endorsing will be a function of mentioning a player in a manner saying something like “We/I endorse @player; same for player endorsing players directly, reputation + from similar population followings). GMs will probably create/change factions every decade and parties will be able to join factions.
Current Government:
* Who is the Governor/Governor-General in 1853?
* Are there Provincial Superintendents for each province? Names?
* Is there a colonial legislature yet, or only provincial councils?
* What is the current government's political composition?
* Any opposition coalitions formed?
Governor John P. Marsden. Vulteralia’s Superintendent Monsieur Armand DuBois. New Zealand’s Superintendent William S. Hamilton. Cooksland Superintendent Frederick L. Davies. New Caledonia, Orketers, Tasminata, Southland are up for election. (Players will have to create a federal or provincial bill regarding length of terms). Constitution will explain government composition. 
Electoral System:
* Property qualifications for voting? (£ value or acreage required)
* Who can vote? (European men only? Māori chiefs? Property owners?)
* Electoral districts - boundaries and representation ratios?
* How often are elections held?
* Secret ballot or show of hands?
* When was the last election? Next scheduled election?
As of now, White Male Property Owner can vote. (No value or acreage required unless policy voted in; policies and vote will be seen at end of turn, GMs will instruct AI if systems needs to be changed, when policy is approved by GM after passing, AI will then automate economy, reputation. (Do you think events should be GM made rather than AI curated?) Elections held will be decided by player set terms, GMs will instruct AI. Show of Hands as of now (counted at end of turn). No scheduled election, GMs will create narrative event until enough players join. If not, narrative event starts game off. 
Legislature Structure:
* Unicameral or bicameral? (Lower House + Upper House/Council?)
* How many seats total? Seats per province?
* Appointed vs. elected seats?
* Term lengths?
* Māori representation - separate seats or integrated?
Bicameral, constitution will provide. 35 Lower House: 1 Seat per 815 people. Southland: 14; Vulteralia: 6; Cooksland: 5; Tasminata: 5; New Zealand: 4; New Caledonia: 1; Te Moana-a-Toir: 0. Upper House: 14 (will be replaced by players, narrative event to bypass for life clause) No term lengths as of now. No Maori representation. 
2. ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS
Currency & Finance:
* What currency is used? (British pounds sterling? Colonial pounds? Mix?)
* Exchange rates if multiple currencies exist?

British Pounds Sterling. No exchange rates. No National/ Provincial Bank; local banks exist. Yes interest rate. Yes government debt levels. Tax rates reflecting Colonial/(Real-Life)New Zealand taxes in the 1850s (British ones cannot be changed through policy, Zealandia tax rates are yet to be established). Set player start fund to 10k as well. 
Starting Resources by Province:
* Which provinces have which of the 30 resources discovered already?
* Resource quantities/deposits per province at game start?

Create data dashboard on exports and imports for economy (events will drive describe countries supply/demand as event for changes, do not show where exports go to or where imports come from, GM job in events). Look to real life for exports and import dependencies. Trade Partners should reflect exports/imports of the era (look to real life sources if you need to). Tariff policies should align with British Empire (1850 or before). Yes to Market prices for the 30 resources at game start (players cannot buy directly, only ETF of sector in Stock Market).

* Māori-owned land percentages per province?
* Land prices per acre by province and quality?
* Squatting/leasehold systems in operation?

(Can AI use Json to simulate culture expansion as European expansion or will GMs need to provide new maps occasionally, or both) Crown lands -> refer to lore for answer. Land price per acre by province and quality (scale to gdp and gd as to now overprice, & reflect the era time) Squatting/leaseing as a statistic group for population demographic dashboard.
